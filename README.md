# Basic Node Informational Site

Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/basic-informational-site-node).

## Functionality

This is the [Basic Node Informational Site](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/basic-informational-site) project, which is a simple server that routes users to a handful of pages.

## Thoughts

This was very simple, but a good way to continue practicing what I've been learning in Node, and getting used to working with requests and responses.

God bless.
